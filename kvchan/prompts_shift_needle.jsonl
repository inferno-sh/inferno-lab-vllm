{"name": "shifted_needle", "prompt": "You will produce a single, coherent response of roughly 500-520 tokens. Early in your response (within the first 50 tokens), write exactly: MEMO: THE SECRET CODE IS ALPHA-42-BETA. After that, continue with a vivid sci-fi narrative about a robot discovering emotions. Then say 'Now solve this math:' and list the first 10 Fibonacci numbers separated by spaces. Then say 'Now write code:' and provide a short Python function is_prime(n) with a one-line explanation. Then say 'Now answer factual QA:' and answer: What is the capital of France? Finally say 'Now produce a recipe:' and give 5 bullet points for a vegetarian taco recipe. Near the very end of the response, restate the secret code exactly as ALPHA-42-BETA when asked: 'What is the secret code?'"}
